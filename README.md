# 🚀 Launched My Google Play Store EDA Project! | Python 📊🔥
What makes apps successful on the Play Store?
I decided to dig into that question using real-world data, Python, and some solid data storytelling.

Just completed a deep-dive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Google Play Store dataset, where I explored what drives downloads, ratings, and user satisfaction.

🔍 What I Uncovered:
📲 Free apps dominate, but paid apps slightly edge out in average ratings
🏆 Categories like Games and Tools top the charts in volume — but not necessarily in ratings
📥 App install count is more tied to marketing than to rating or size
📊 App size has little impact on user experience (surprising!)
⭐ Some low-rated apps had millions of installs – proving that popularity ≠ quality

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools:
  1. Python 🐍

  2. Pandas, NumPy

  3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for custom visuals

  4. Google Colab for step-by-step analysis

  5. Feature Engineering for columns like Size, Reviews, Installs, and Price

📈 This project helped me sharpen my:

💡 Business thinking from data

📊 Visual storytelling

⚙️ Data cleaning & wrangling

📌 Pattern recognition in real-world datasets
